# Flutter Weather App

This is a Flutter weather app that provides current weather information and a 5-day forecast for selected cities. The app uses the **http** package for making API requests, **`lottie`** for displaying animated weather icons, and _`intl`_ for date and time formatting. Users can view detailed weather information including wind speed, humidity, and cloud coverage.

## Features

- **City Selection**: Choose from a list of predefined cities to view the current weather.

- **Weather Animations**: Utilizes lottie animations to visually represent different weather conditions.
- **5-Day Forecast**: Provides a weather forecast for the next 5 days, including daily weather summaries.
