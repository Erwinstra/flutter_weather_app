# Flutter Weather App

This is a Flutter weather app that provides current weather information and a 5-day forecast for selected cities. The app uses the _http_ package for making API requests, `lottie` for displaying animated weather icons, and _`intl`_ for date and time formatting. Users can view detailed weather information including wind speed, humidity, and cloud coverage.

## Features
